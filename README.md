# smart-contract-security-audit-checklist
1. Download the code
2. Read the documentation
3. CLOC to see the metrics (lines of code and number of contracts) - Rank the contracts on the basis of complexity
4. Take notes in the same code while manual review
5. Don't fall in the rabbit hole (move on to other files once you have spent enough time on it)
6. Ask the people who have made the contract (not always feasibile)
7. Vulnerability reports + Resonsibility disclosures + newsletters
8. Make a comprehensive Audit Report
